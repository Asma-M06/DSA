Sliding window is simply:
expanding the window
shrinking the window
maintaining a condition

Used in:
longest substring
max sum subarray
count distinct elements
frequency-based problems

template:
int left = 0;

for(int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
    
    // expand window with right

    while(windowInvalid) {
        // shrink window with left
        left++;
    }

    // update answer
}


Sliding Window is used when you deal with:
subarrays
substrings
CONTINUOUS segments
"longest", "shortest", "maximum", "minimum" type problems

Example:
"Find the longest substring without repeating characters"
"Find max sum of subarray of size k"
"Find number of substrings with property X"

Types of Sliding Window
=> 1. Fixed-size sliding window
Window size is constant (e.g., size k).
Example:
Max sum of subarray of size k.

=> 2. Variable-size sliding window
Window expands and contracts until it satisfies a condition.
Example:
Longest substring without repeating characters.
